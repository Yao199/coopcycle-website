CROPS4LIFE aims to reduce the environmental and climate footprint of the agrifood system in Vitoria-Gasteiz by steering the local food
choice through a data-intensive, digital and adaptive governance structure. For this project, CoopCycle has been partnering with our local member cooperative, Eraman.

A pilot initiative will be launched setting the foundations for
a short-circuit based territorialized agrifood system, entailing highly productive regenerative agroecological farms, generational change
incorporating new agricultural agents, trading of local products, and analysis and improvement of the regulatory framework.

As for our part of the project, we will be delivering the digital tools that empower the development of local food consumption, by developing a marketplace where you can be home-delivered by bike. We will also build analytical tools to measure the project's impacts.
