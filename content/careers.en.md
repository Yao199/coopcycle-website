# Recruitment Full stack developer

## Who we are and what we do

CoopCycle is an international federation of courier cooperatives. Our aim is to promote good working conditions and cooperative governance in the field of bike delivery while supporting a low carbon emission delivery system in cities.
One of the services we provide is the development and maintenance of a software that helps these cooperatives with their business. The technology includes:
- A front-end ecommerce layer for customers.
- Multiple ways for businesses to provide the jobs info they ask of the cooperatives. (Accounts for BtoB clients with form, possibility to import, plug-ins, API connections)
- A back-end Dispatch system to organize the work of riders.
- Android and iOS applications for all types of users of the platform (Riders / Admin / Shop owners)

## Context

After 5 years of existence, CoopCycle is now growing. We are now looking for a third developer that will help us manage the complexity of the software development environment in which we evolve. In fact, since the beginning, the technology has been developed as a multi-purpose software to answer all our members’ needs. The architecture of the technology has been shaped by Alex (a.k.a Mex) who will keep on playing that role. We are therefore looking for a complementary profile with a person that will both:
- Have a full stack developer profile in order to keep a versatile potential in all team members
- Have interest in future management opportunities in a team dealing with a complex environment.

## Your missions

### Full stack developer

- Developing new features for both the application and the browser version of all aspects of the platform (BtoC / BtoB)
- Resolving issues reported by users.
- Giving insights on technical challenges to improve customer experience.
- Knowledge of the functioning of Git and GitHub’s workflow (issues, projects, ...)
Technologies
- The backend (web platform & API) is made with PHP & Symfony, using the API Platform framework. Experience with PHP & Symfony is a plus, or at least experience with a well-known web framework (Ruby On Rails, Laravel...).
- The frontend is made in vanilla JavaScript (with Babel) & React, using Bootstrap 3 & Sass.
- The mobile app is made with React Native. If you don’t have experience with React Native, you should at least have experience with React.
- Our infrastructure is deployed on various cloud providers using Ansible, and a little bit of Docker. We are not using orchestration software such as Kubernetes, but experience with it is a great plus.

### Examples of potential future managerial roles to fill

- Internal communication with the team. You are the person responsible for the right information to land in the right people’s hands both on the tech and non-tech sides.
- Communication with CoopCycle members (= software users) :
- Collect the bug/features requests, ensure the follow-up of these
- Communicate to CoopCycle members about roadmaps, software change,
aso.
- Implement and manage the Scrum process. (Daily, Sprint review and planning,
Retrospective). Profile:
- Full stack developer
- Organizational ability
- Good communication skills
- Interest in the development of cooperatives and platform cooperativism.

- Interest in the development of bike delivery and low carbon emission modes of transportation.

## Working conditions

- Salary: Salary range to be determined based on geographic area of applicant. (Example: In France our base dev salary is 2.600 € gross monthly)
- Place: Liège (Belgium) / Hambourg (Germany) / Nantes (France) / Saint-Maur des Fossés (France) / / Grenoble (France) / Vitoria Gasteiz (Spain) - in order to collaborate and see real-time needs of one of our delivery co-op.
- Language: English fluent + Either French / Spanish spoken.
- Remote work can go up to 3 days a week, the remaining 2 days (or more if you feel like it) should be spent at a local cooperative’s place so that a direct connection can be made with users from the software.
- Possibility to explore the idea of working on a potential 80% development work with 20% courier work on the side if you are curious about the job you will be developing for and eager to get out of the office to ride the bike!
- Due to being a small team running food tech software, some limited on-call needs will likely exist, but they are something we share in a collaborative way as a team.

Applications to be sent at work@coopcycle.org until Wednesday 8th of February 12pm.

Interviews will take place week starting Monday 20th of February.
